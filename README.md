## Combinatorics
> Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting, both as a means and an end in obtaining results, and certain properties of finite structures. It is closely related to many other areas of mathematics and has many applications ranging from logic to statistical physics, from evolutionary biology to computer science, etc. <br>

* Fundamentals
    * Finding Power of Factorial Divisor<br>
    ```n!=1⋅2⋅3…(n−1)⋅n```<br>
    <https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/factorial-divisors.html>
    * Binomial Coefficients<br>
    ```(a+b)n=(n0)an+(n1)an−1b+(n2)an−2b2+⋯+(nk)an−kbk+⋯+(nn)bn```<br>
    <https://cp-algorithms.com/combinatorics/binomial-coefficients.html>
    * Catalan Numbers<br>
    ```C0=C1=1 <br> Cn=∑k=0n−1CkCn−1−k,n≥2```<br>
    <https://cp-algorithms.com/combinatorics/catalan-numbers.html>
* Techniques
    * The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle<br>
    ```∣∣∣⋃i=1nAi∣∣∣=∑i=1n|Ai|−∑1≤i<j≤n|Ai∩Aj|+∑1≤i<j<k≤n|Ai∩Aj∩Ak|−⋯+(−1)n−1|A1∩⋯∩An|```<br>
    <https://cp-algorithms.com/combinatorics/inclusion-exclusion.html>
    * Burnside's lemma / Pólya enumeration theorem<br>
    ```f2π≡f1```<br>
    <https://cp-algorithms.com/combinatorics/burnside.html>
    * Stars and bars<br>
    ```(n+k−1n).```<br>
    <https://cp-algorithms.com/combinatorics/stars_and_bars.html>
    * Generating all K-combinations<br>
    ```G(N)=0G(N−1)∪1G(N−1)R```<br>
    <https://cp-algorithms.com/combinatorics/generating_combinations.html>
* Tasks
    * Placing Bishops on a Chessboard<br>
    ```Let D[i][j] denote the number of ways to place j bishops on diagonals with indices up to i which have the same color as diagonal i. Then i = 1...2N-1 and j = 0...K.```<br>
    <https://cp-algorithms.com/combinatorics/bishops-on-chessboard.html>
    * Balanced bracket sequences<br>
    ```d[n]=∑i=0n−1d[i]⋅d[n−1−i]```<br>
    <https://cp-algorithms.com/combinatorics/bracket_sequences.html>
    * Counting labeled graphs<br>
    ```D[n][k]=∑s=1n(n−1s−1)CsD[n−s][k−1]```<br>
